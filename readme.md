# SQL
This repository contains my SQL project.

The problem definition is:

*Create application which access database via EntityFramework or other ORM, to export sale report. All table data is exported in `csv` file on some period. Every row should be tagged with date and if it was exported. Export is made only on new or edited rows. Think of the case when export fails. For extra points add ability to re-export old data from pointed date.*
